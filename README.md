# Belly_Button_Challenge
Belly Button Biodiversity

This Challenge is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the **Belly Button Biodiversity** dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard deployed as part of this challenge can be viewed at https://snnandhini.github.io/Belly_Button_Challenge/

The dashboard has a Dropdown Menu listing the Test Subject IDs to choose from, a Demographic Information Panel, a Horizontal Bar Chart, a Bubble Chart and a Gauge Chart.
